Generated documentation of builtins (and perhaps more later) go here.

To generate documentation, run the ``docs`` task of the nakefile by compiling the nakefile::

  $ nim c nakefile

and then::

  $ ./nakefile docs

If you have the ``nimble`` package installed already, then you can just do::

  $ nake docs
