description
("You are nearing a huge mountain. The rugged trail starts north and twists around the mountain. You wonder how long it will take you to climb up the mountain, especially with the strong winds blowing near the top. The white snow at the top glistens in the sunlight, causing you to avert your eyes from the brightness. The rocks on this mountain are a mixture of brown and gray, and there is a smattering of small shrubs growing here and there.")
